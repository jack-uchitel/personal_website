# personal_website
This is the code for my personal website, which can be seen at jackuchitel.com.

The website is coded with React, and this is its first version. For the second version of my website,
the following changes will be implemented:

1. On the Projets panel, click functionality on desktop devices will be added, so users can scroll over
descriptions with greater ease. Furthermore, the fade will be slightly extended.

2. On Safari and older versions of some browser engines, the Title panel starts very high up. I did no
quality assurance when it came to supporting webkit and moz and whatnot, so I will start there, and if that
doesn't work try other things to debug it.

3. The Python logo has additional whitespace â€“ instead of pulling images from the internet, I will crop them
and save them to my server so I don't have to worry about them going unsupported. In a similar context, the
account logos behave oddly, and the resume logo doesn't wear the opacity change as well as I'd like. I'll
fix that. 

4. The form at the end doesn't go anywhere, because I am a ~front-end designer~. I'm not losing sleep over
this, as I specify it should be used to report feeback on the website which I don't want right now and I don't
want to use PHP or something ungodly, but I'll implement it in one of the coming versions of the website.

5. Miscellanous other changes and mobile support.

Stay tuned!
